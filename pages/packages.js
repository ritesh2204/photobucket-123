              If you have created your blog to promote your business, you’ll
              want to make sure that there’s a page that details the goods and
              services that you sell. Alternatively, if you already have a
              website for your business, you can provide a link to it in your
              menu. A blog is a low-cost, low-risk way to invite readers into
              your world and begin a conversation with your company. 68% of
              consumers are likely to spend time reading content produced by a
              company they are interested in.
